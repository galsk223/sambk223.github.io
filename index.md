I am a second year M.S. student at Colorado State University, in the department of Agriculture and Resource Economics.

My current research is on the impact of oil and gas well activity on local student test scores. I am also working on the Colorado COVID response modeling team, connecting epidemiological outcomes and economic impacts. Broadly I am interested in environmental and natural resource economics, especially as it relates to human capital, land use, and biodiversity. 

If I'm not coding, you can find me staring at my houseplants, hanging out with my perfect dog Amber, snowboarding, or playing bass. I'm always listening to music, and right now am really into contemporary jazz from the UK.
